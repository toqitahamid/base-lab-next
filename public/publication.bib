abstract = {Abstract This study investigated the possibility of using a laser methane detector (LMD) and optical gas imaging (OGI) to detect and quantify enteric methane (CH4\${\rm CH}\_4\$) produced by ruminants in vitro. Four single-flow continuous fermenters were used for rumen culture incubation with four different treatment diets: Control (50:50 forage to concentrate [F:C] ratio), Control + Bromoform (CBR), Low Forage (LF; 20:80), and High Forage (HF; 80:20). After 10 days of incubation, all fermenter contents were transferred and used in a 24 h ANKOM batch culture to measure CH4\${\rm CH}\_4\$ gas production with LMD and OGI. The authors introduce the Controlled Diet (CD) dataset, a large-scale collection of 4,885 CH4\${\rm CH}\_4\$ plume images captured using an FLIR GF77 OGI camera under varying dietary conditions. The performance of six semantic segmentation models (FCN, U-Net, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, DeepLabv3+, and Gasformer) on the CD dataset is compared. Results showed that LMD data for CH4\${\rm CH}\_4\$ followed a similar pattern to the gas chromatography (GC) instrument results. The in vitro results showed that different diets and F:C ratios had an impact on CH4\${\rm CH}\_4\$ gas production and rumen fermentation characteristics. Adding bromoform to the control diet fully inhibited CH4\${\rm CH}\_4\$ emission. The HF diet produced more CH4\${\rm CH}\_4\$ compared to all treatments (p<0.01\$p<0.01\$) when measured with GC and LMD. CBR produced the lowest CH4\${\rm CH}\_4\$ values when measured with GC and LMD. The Gasformer architecture achieved the highest performance with mean IoU of 85.1\% and mean F-score of 91.72\%. These findings demonstrate that OGI technology combined with advanced semantic segmentation models offers a promising solution for predicting and quantifying CH4\${\rm CH}\_4\$ emissions in the livestock sector, potentially aiding in the development of mitigation strategies to combat climate change.},
